1. Interaction between client and server is very simple, for every client request there is only one service response;
    Btw gRPC also support a more fancy IPC interaction styles:
        a.Unary RPC -> Client sends only one request to server and receive only one response from server;
        b. Concurrent on server;
        c. Concurrent on client;
        d. Concurrent from both sides;
