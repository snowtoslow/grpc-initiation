1. Interaction between client and server is very simple, for every client request there is only one service response;
    Btw gRPC also support a more fancy IPC interaction styles:
        a.Unary RPC -> Client sends only one request to server and receive only one response from server;
        b. Server side streaming RPC -> for one client request the server returns multiple rsponses as stream;
        c. Client side streaming RPC;
        d. Bi-directional streaming RPC;



HOW TO RUN THIS EXAMPLES:

from grpc-initiation directory

1.SERVER:
    cd second-module/service && protoc -I order order/order-service.proto --go_out=plugins=grpc:$GOPATH/src/grpc-initiation/second-module/service/order

2.Client:
    cd second-module/client && protoc -I order order/order-service.proto --go_out=plugins=grpc:$GOPATH/src/grpc-initiation/second-module/client/order
